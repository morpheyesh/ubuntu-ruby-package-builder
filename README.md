Why the fork?
=============
I wanted a newer version of ruby, but also with --enable-shared specified as a configure flag.

Major differences with the original author's 1.9.3-p125 script are:
* all necessary lib*dev dependencies installed before compilation
* use of libyaml-0-2 instead of compiling yaml from source
* specification of --enable-shared
* tightened up minimum dependecy versions to match an up-to-date Ubuntu 12.04 (on Jan 20, 2013)

Ubuntu Ruby Package Builder
===========================

A few scripts to make it easy to build Ruby .deb packages on Ubuntu.

All scripts require 'fpm' to create the .deb.
